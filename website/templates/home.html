{# --- Workout Progress History UI INTEGRATION PLAN (for maintainers/designers) --- #}
{# 
  The following is a technical plan for adding a workout session history and progress tracking interface to the existing Flask/Jinja2 UI.

  1. EXISTING STRUCTURE:
    - Main templates:
      * base.html: Base layout with nav. 
      * home.html: "Home" - lists all workouts for current user; navigates to workout details or edit.
      * workout.html: Per-workout view (log/edit weights/details for today's session).
      * edit-workout.html, new-workout.html: For creating or editing workout and exercises.
    - Navigation: 
      * Navbar has direct links: Home, Workout, Logout.
      * Home has a button per workout, plus add/edit.

  2. API for session data:
    - Implemented at /api/workout/history (GET returns [sessions], POST logs a new session).

  3. HOW TO INTEGRATE "WORKOUT HISTORY" UI:
    * Add a new page/view: "Workout History" (e.g., at /history or /workout/history).
        - Accessible from navbar (add nav item: "History").
    * UI Components for the History Page:
      a) Summary of all past sessions by date, most recent first.
      b) Per session: Show workout name, timestamp, and all exercise logs (weights, reps, details, etc.).
      c) Optionally, add per-workout filter (dropdown) to filter history to a specific workout.
      d) (Advanced/future) Sparkline or chart components to visualize progress for each exercise.
    * General navigation flow:
      - User logs in and lands on Home.
      - New nav item "History" lets user access their session history.
      - From a session, optionally provide link back to that workout or allow session deletion (future).
      - If session data is empty, show a message indicating no workout history exists yet.

  4. RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION:
    - New template: templates/history.html (extends base, uses container layout).
    - New view: Python handler at GET /history to render the page, fetches session data via backend API or DB query.
    - JS enhancement: Optionally use fetch XHR to allow live filtering/progress, but can be fully server-side Jinja.
    - Nav update: Edit base.html to add "History" item, ensure active state.
    - Styling: Re-use container, table/list, card components (see workout/exercise display).
    - Data Source: Use existing models.WorkoutSession and ExerciseLog; query sorted by timestamp.

  5. FILES TO UPDATE/CREATE:
    - templates/base.html (add nav)
    - templates/history.html (new!)
    - views.py (add history view handler)
    - Optionally static/js/history.js (for future interactive features)

  This plan provides a clear and practical path to surface workout history with minimal risk to existing UI.
