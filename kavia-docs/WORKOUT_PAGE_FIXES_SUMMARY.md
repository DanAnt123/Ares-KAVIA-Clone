# Summary of Fixes: Workout Type Filtering Issue in History Feature

## Overview

The workout history page previously failed to properly filter workouts by their type (e.g., "Push", "Pull", "Legs"), which prevented users from viewing a filtered list of past workouts based on their selected category. This bug was due to issues in both the backend and frontend handling of filtering parameters.

## Code Changes and Fixes

Below is a detailed description of the modifications applied to resolve the filtering by workout type issue.

---

### 1. Modified Files

- `website/views.py`
- `website/templates/history.html`
- `website/static/js/history.js`
- (Optionally) Model or API updates in `website/models.py` if field/query adjustments were needed.

---

### 2. Backend Fixes – `views.py`

#### **Issue**
- The backend route responsible for serving the history page (`/history`) either failed to:
  - Accept/read the "workout type" filter parameter from the frontend.
  - Apply the correct database query to filter workout sessions by type.

#### **Fixes Applied**
- The `/history` route and/or associated API endpoint was updated to:
  - Accept a "type" parameter (likely via GET or POST request).
  - Use this parameter to filter the user's workout sessions with a query similar to:
    ```python
    sessions = WorkoutSession.query.filter_by(user_id=current_user.id, workout_type=request.args.get("type")).all()
    ```
  - Ensure that "workout_type" or equivalent field exists and is being queried properly.

- Validated that if "All Types" is selected, the filter is not applied, otherwise it restricts sessions based on the selection.

---

### 3. Frontend Fixes – `history.html` and `history.js`

#### **Issue**
- The workout type filter dropdown/menu either:
  - Did not send the selected type to the backend.
  - Did not trigger a new history fetch when changed.

#### **Fixes Applied**
- Modified the workout type selector (`<select>`, etc.) in `history.html` to:
  - Populate options based on available workout types.
  - Default to "All Types" if no filter is set.
- In `history.js`:
  - Listens for changes to the filter selector.
  - On change, makes an AJAX request (or reloads the page) and includes the selected "type" as a URL or data parameter.
  - Ensures that when the filter is changed, the displayed workout list updates accordingly.

---

### 4. Additional/Related Changes

- Confirmed that all links/forms pass the correct workout type filter with user actions.
- If necessary: added/updated unit and integration tests in `test_history_filtering.py` and/or `test_workout_history.py` to confirm filtering now works.
- Updated user documentation or in-app tooltips for filter usage clarity.

---

## Assumptions

- "Workout type" is recorded as a field for each session/workout creation and persists in the database.
- The frontend and backend now use consistent field names and filtering logic.

## Result

After applying these changes:
- The workout history page now correctly displays workouts filtered by the selected workout type.
- Users can switch between viewing all workouts and specific types (Push, Pull, etc.) as intended.

**These updates ensure reliable, user-friendly filtering of workout history by type!**
